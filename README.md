# Hearthstone Journal
_Based on [Soulshape Journal](https://github.com/christopheml/soulshape-journal) by [Christophe Michel](https://github.com/christopheml)_

Adds a tab in the Collections Journal to track your cosmetic hearthstone collection and provides instructions to unlock new ones.

## Installation

### Using Curse/Overwolf

Hearthstone Journal has been [added to Curseforge](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/hearthstone-journal) and should be available from your Curse/Overwolf client.

### Using a third party client and Github

Most third-party clients allow installing addons directly from Github.

#### Ajour

Click "Install from an URL", paste `https://github.com/nikibobi/hearthstone-journal` and follow instructions. 
Ajour should pick up updates when they're published.

#### WowUp

Select "Get Addons", then on the top-right corner, click "Install from URL", paste `https://github.com/nikibobi/hearthstone-journal` and click "Import". 
WowUp should pick up updates when they're published.

### Manual installation from Github

* Click [Releases](https://github.com/nikibobi/hearthstone-journal/releases/) and from the latest release, click the `HearthstoneJournal-x.y.zip` link to download the zip file.
* Unzip the zip file into your retail Addons directory.
* Reload your UI if you were in-game.

## Licensing

The project is released under the [MIT License](LICENSE.txt).

## Reporting issues

If you find an bug or want to suggest a feature or enhancement, please create an issue on this repository. Github is the only channel I'll monitor for this purpose. 

Before you create an issue about a bug, make sure it hasn't already submitted before or not in the list below. Please attach any relevant information you have, including Lua stacktraces, steps you took to trigger the bug and the list of other addons you use (I would be extra kind to narrow down that list by reproducing the bug with other addons disabled, in case the bug is caused by an incompatibility between Hearthstone Journal and another addon).

### Known issues

* Due to a difference in how both addons handle adding a tab to the Collections Journal frame, Hearthstone Journal **is not compatible with iStableMaster**. This isn't something I can realistically change on my own and won't probably be fixed.

## Planned Features
* Quick buttons on the top of the panel for functional hearthstones like Dalaran and Garrison hearthstones
